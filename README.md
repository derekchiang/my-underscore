# my-underscore

A reimplementation of underscore.js

## Why???

I'm learning JavaScript the hard way.  Basically I just look at the underscore.js function list and implement those functions one by one, according to their specifications.  Then I compare my implementation with underscore's implementation, and think about why they do it that way.

I've learned a lot.  Maybe you should do something like this too!

## Should I use this library?

Most likely not; unless you REALLY REALLY trust me :P
